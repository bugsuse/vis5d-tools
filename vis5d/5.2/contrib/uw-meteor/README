The files in this directory can be used to write VIS format files and
then convert a sequence of these files into a .v5d file.


viswrite_unix.f - This file contains FORTRAN subroutines that will write 
                  VIS format files on a generic unix platform. This has 
                  been tested on an SGI personal iris, and should work on 
                  any 32 bit unix machine, although some of the bit 
                  manipulation subroutines (intrshft, intlshft, intand, intor) 
                  may need to be modified for a particular machine.  There 
                  is one subroutine (READROUTINE) which must be supplied by 
                  the user to fill an array with the appropriate values.

viswrite_cray.f - This file contains FORTRAN subroutines that will write 
                  VIS format files on a CRAY YMP/864 running unicos.  This 
                  has been tested on the CRAY YMP/864 at NCAR.  There is 
                  one subroutine (READROUTINE) which must be supplied by the 
                  user to fill an array with the appropriate values.

driver.f        - A sample call to VISWRITE that was used to test the 
                  subroutines on the various platforms.


vis_to_v5d.c	- This program converts NMS VIS files to .v5d format.

		  To compile it type make.  

		  Example:  To convert VIS.1, VIS.2, and VIS.3 to a .v5d
			file, you'd type:

			vis_to_v5d VIS.1 VIS.2 VIS.3 mydata.v5d
    
		  If the VIS format files have the 3 wind components 
		  as variables U, V, and W, then a speed flag may be
		  used to generate SPEED from the components as:

			vis_to_v5d +spd VIS.1 VIS.2 VIS.3 mydata.v5d

SECTION 2: GRID DESCRIPTION SECTION (GDS)

     The purpose of the (optional) GDS is to provide a grid description
for grids not defined by number in Table B.

     Octet no.                     GDS Content

      1 - 3        Length in octets of the Grid Description Section

      4           NV, the number of vertical coordinate parameters

      5           PV, the location (octet number) of the list of

             vertical coordinate parameters, if present
                  or
                  PL, the location (octet number) of the list of
                  numbers of points in each row (when no vertical
                  parameters are present), if present
                  or
                  255 (all bits set to 1) if neither are present

      6           Data representation type (See Table 6)

      7 - 32      Grid description, according to data
                  representation type, except Lambert, Mercator or
                  Space View.
     or

      7 - 42      Grid description for Lambert or Mercator grid

     or

      7 - 44      Grid description for Space View perspective grid

     PV           List of vertical coordinate parameters
                  (length = NV x 4 octets);
                  if present, then PL = 4 x NV + PV

     PL           List of numbers of points in each row, used for
                  quasi-regular grids
                  (length = NROWS x 2 octets, where NROWS is the
                  total number of rows defined within the grid
                  description)

     Note:     NV and PV relate to features of GRIB not, at present, in
               use in international exchange.  See the WMO Manual on
               Codes&lt;1&gt; for the descriptions of those features.

               PL is used for &quot;quasi-regular&quot; or &quot;thinned&quot; grids; e.g.,
               a lat/lon grid where the number of points in each row is
               reduced as one moves poleward from the equator.  The
               reduction usually follows some mathematical formula
               involving the cosine of the latitude, to generate an
               (approximately) equally spaced grid array.  The
               association of the numbers in octet PL (and following)
               with the particular row follows the scanning mode
               specification in Table 8.

          1         The complex coefficients Xnm are stored for   m &gt; 0
                    as pairs of real numbers Re(Xnm), Im(Xnm) ordered
                    with n increasing from m to N(m), first for m = 0
                    and then for m = 1, 2, 3,...M.  The real part of
                    the (0,0) coefficient is stored in octets 12-15 of
                    the BDS, as a floating point number in the same
                    manner as the packing reference value, with units
                    as in Table 2.  The remaining coefficients,
                    starting with the imaginary part of the (0,0)
                    coefficient, are packed according to the GRIB
                    packing algorithm, with units as given in Table 5,
                    in octets 16 and onward in the BDS.


NOTES ON SPECTRAL TRUNCATION:

     Using the associated Legendre Polynomials of the First Kind, Pnm,
as typical expansion functions, any variable x(,), which is a function
of longitude,  , and sin(latitude),  , can be represented by





     In the summations, M is the maximum zonal wave number that is to
be included, and K &amp; J together define the maximum meridional total
wave number N(m), which, it should be noted, is a function of m.  A
sketch shows the relationships:




     In this figure, the ordinate is n the zonal wave number, the
abscissa, m, is the total meridional wave number, the vertical line at
m = M is the zonal truncation, and the diagonal passing through (0,0)
is the line n = m.  The Legendre Polynomials are defined only on or
above this line, that is for n &gt; m.  On the n-axis, the horizontal line
at n = K indicates the upper limit to n values, and the diagonal that
intersects the n-axis at n = J indicates the upper limit of the area in
which the Polynomials are defined.  The shaded irregular pentagon
defined by the n-axis, the diagonal from n = J, the horizontal n = K,
the vertical m = M, and the other diagonal n = m surrounds the region
of the (n x m) plane containing the Legendre Polynomials used in the
expansion.

     This general pentagonal truncation reduces to some familiar common
truncations as special cases:

          Triangular:    K = J = M and N(m) = J
          Rhomboidal:    K = J + M and N(m) = J + m
          Trapezoidal:   K = J, K &gt; M and N(m) = J

     In all of the above m can take on negative values to represent the
imaginary part of the spectral coefficients.

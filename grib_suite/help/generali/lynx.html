   Lynx is a fully-featured World Wide Web (WWW) client for users running
   cursor-addressable, character-cell display devices (e.g., vt100
   terminals, vt100 emulators running on PCs or Macs, or any other
   character-cell display). It will display Hypertext Markup Language
   (HTML) documents containing links to files on the local system, as
   well as files on remote systems running http, gopher, ftp, wais, nntp,
   finger, or cso/ph/qi servers, and services accessible via logins to
   telnet, tn3270 or rlogin accounts (see URL Schemes Supported by Lynx).
   Current versions of Lynx run on Unix, VMS, Windows95/NT, 386DOS and
   OS/2 EMX.

   Lynx can be used to access information on the WWW, or to build
   information systems intended primarily for local access. For example,
   Lynx has been used to build several Campus Wide Information Systems
   (CWIS). In addition, Lynx can be used to build systems isolated within
   a single LAN.

 Lynx online help

   Online help is available while viewing any document. Press the '?' or
   'H' key (or the 'h key if vi-like key movement is not on) to see a
   list of help topics. See the section titled Navigating hypertext
   documents with Lynx for information on navigating through the help
   files.

   In addition, a summary description of all the Lynx keystroke commands
   and their key bindings is available by pressing the 'K' key (or the
   'k' key if vi-like key movement is not on). [ToC]

 Viewing local files with Lynx

   Lynx can be started by entering the Lynx command along with the name
   of a file to display. For example these commands could all be used to
   display an arbitrary ASCII text or HTML file:

   UNIX
          lynx filename
          lynx /home/my-dir/filename
          lynx ~/filename

   VMS
          lynx filename
          lynx dua5:[my-directory]filename
          lynx /dua5/my-directory/filename
          lynx ~/filename
          lynx sys$login:filename
          lynx /sys$login/filename

   Win32/DOS
          lynx file:///filename
          lynx filename
          lynx c:/dir/filename
          lynx //n/dir/filename

   When executed, Lynx will clear the screen and display as much of the
   specified file as will fit on the screen. Pressing a down-arrow will
   bring up the next screen, and pressing an up-arrow will bring up the
   previous screen. If no file is specified at startup, a default file
   will be displayed. (The default is configured by the system
   administrator when the command is installed.)

   Lynx will display local files written in the HyperText Markup Language
   (HTML), if the file's name ends with the characters .html, .htm,
   .shtml, .htmlx, .html3, or .ht3. HTML is a file format that allows
   users to create a file that contains (among other things) hypertext
   links to other files. Several files linked together may be described
   as a hypertext document. If the filename does not have one of the
   suffixes mapped by Lynx to HTML, the -force_html command line option
   can be included to force treatment of the file as hypertext.

   When Lynx displays an HTML file, it shows links as &quot;bold face&quot; text,
   except for one link, which is shown as &quot;highlighted&quot; text. Whether
   &quot;boldface&quot; or &quot;highlighted&quot; text shows up as reverse video, boldface
   type, or a color change, etc. depends on the display device being used
   (and the way in which that device has been configured). Lynx has no
   control over the exact presentation of links.

   The one link displayed as &quot;highlighted&quot; text is the currently
   &quot;selected&quot; link. Lynx will display the file associated with the
   selected link when a right-arrow or a Return key is pressed. To select
   a particular link, press the up-arrow or down-arrow keys until the
   desired link becomes &quot;highlighted,&quot; and then press the right-arrow or
   Return key to view the linked information. Information included in the
   HTML file tells Lynx where to find the linked file and what kind of
   server will provide it (i.e. HTTP, Gopher, etc.).

   Lynx renders HTML files and saves the rendition, not the source, for
   initial display and should you select the link again. If you do select
   a link again and have reason to desire a new fetch and rendering of
   the file, use the NOCACHE command, normally mapped to 'x' and 'X',
   instead of the right-arrow or Return key when positioned on the link.
   You also can force a new fetch and rendering of the currently
   displayed document via the RELOAD command, normally mapped to
   Control-R.

   When a binary file is encountered Lynx will ask the user if he/she
   wishes to download the file or cancel. If the user selects 'D' for
   download, Lynx will transfer the file into a temporary location and
   present the user with a list of options. The only default option is
   Save to disk, which is disabled if Lynx is running in anonymous mode.
   Any number of additional download methods may be defined in the
   lynx.cfg file by the system administrator. Programs like kermit,
   zmodem and FTP are some possible options. [ToC]

 Leaving Lynx

   To exit Lynx use the 'q' command. You will be asked whether you really
   want to quit. Answering 'y' will exit and 'n' will return you to the
   current document. Use 'Q' or Control-D to quit without verification.
   [ToC]

 Starting Lynx with a Remote File

   If you wish to view a remote file (that is, a file residing on some
   computer system other than the one upon which you are running Lynx)
   without first viewing a local file, you must identify that file by
   using a Uniform Resource Locator (URL). URLs take the general form:

   PROTOCOL :// HOST / PATH

   where

   PROTOCOL
          identifies the communications protocol (scheme) used by the
          server that will provide the file. As mentioned earlier, Lynx
          (and any WWW client) can interact with a variety of servers,
          each with its own protocol.

   HOST
          is the Internet address of the computer system on which the
          server is running, and

   PATH
          is a scheme-specific field which for some schemes may
          correspond to a directory path and/or filename.

   Here are some sample URLs.

   HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol)
          http://www.crl.com/~subir/lynx.html

   Gopher
          gopher://gopher.micro.umn.edu/11/

   FTP (File Transfer Protocol)
          ftp://ftp2.cc.ukans.edu/pub/lynx/README

   WAIS (Wide Area Information Service protocol)
          wais://cnidr.org/directory-of-servers

   A URL may be specified to Lynx on the command line, as in:
          lynx http://kufacts.cc.ukans.edu/cwis/kufacts_start.html

   Lynx also will attempt to create a complete URL if you include
   adequate portions of it in the startfile argument. For example:
                 wfbr          will be expanded to:
      http://www.wfbr.edu/     and:
             ftp.more.net/pub  will be expanded to:
       ftp://ftp.more.net/pub
   See URL Schemes Supported by Lynx for more detailed information. [ToC]

 Starting Lynx with the WWW_HOME environment variable.

   You may also specify a starting file for Lynx using the WWW_HOME
   environment variable,

   UNIX

        ksh
                export WWW_HOME=http://www.w3.org/

        csh
                setenv WWW_HOME http://www.w3.org/

   VMS
          define &quot;WWW_HOME&quot; &quot;http://www.w3.org/&quot;

   win32
          WWW_HOME=http://www.w3.org/ [or in registry]

   Note that on VMS the double-quoting must be included to preserve
   casing.

 Navigating hypertext documents with Lynx

   The process of moving within a hypertext web, selecting and displaying
   links is known as &quot;navigation.&quot; With Lynx almost all navigation can be
   accomplished with the arrow keys and the numeric keypad.

                                       +-------+-------+-------+
                                       | TOP   |  /|\  | Page  |
              arrow keys               | of    |   |   | UP    |
                                       | text 7|   |  8|      9|
              +---------+              +-------+-------+-------+
              | SELECT  |              |       |       |       |
              | prev /|\|              | &lt;---  |       |  ---&gt; |
              | link  | |              |      4|      5|      6|
    +---------+---------+---------+    +-------+-------+-------+
    |    BACK | SELECT  | DISPLAY |    | END   |   |   | Page  |
    |&lt;-- prev | next  | | sel. --&gt;|    | of    |   |   | DOWN  |
    |    doc. | link \|/| link    |    | text 1|  \|/ 2|      3|
    +---------+---------+---------+    +-------+-------+-------+

   There are also a few other keyboard commands to aid in navigation. The
   Control and Function keys used for navigation within the current
   document are described in Scrolling and Other useful commands. Some
   additional commands depend on the fact that Lynx keeps a list of each
   link you visited to reach the current document, called the History
   Page, and a list of all links visited during the current Lynx session,
   called the Visited Links Page. The HISTORY keystroke command, normally
   mapped to Backspace or Delete, will show you the History Page of links
   leading to your access of the current document. Any of the previous
   documents shown in the list may be revisited by selecting them from
   the history screen. The VLINKS keystroke command, normally mapped to
   uppercase 'V', will show the Visited Links Page, and you similarly can
   select links in that list. The MAIN_MENU keystroke command, normally
   mapped to 'm' and 'M', will take you back to the starting document
   unless you specified the -homepage=URL option at the command line.
   Also, the LIST keystroke command, normally mapped to 'l' and L', will
   create a compact list of all the links in the current document, and
   they can be selected via that list.

   The 'i' key presents an index of documents. The default index is
   usually a document pointing to servers around the world, but the index
   can be changed by the system administrator or on the command line
   using the -index=URL switch, and therefore depends on how the Lynx
   program you are using was configured.

   If you choose a link to a server with active access authorization,
   Lynx will automatically prompt for a username and a password. If you
   give the correct information, you will then be served the requested
   information. Lynx will automatically send your username and password
   to the same server if it is needed again. [ToC]

 Printing, Mailing, and Saving rendered files to disk.

   Rendered HTML documents, and plain text files, may be printed using
   the 'p' command while viewing the document. After pressing the 'p' key
   a menu of Print Options will be displayed. The menu will vary
   according to several factors. First, some sites set up special
   accounts to let users run Lynx to access local information systems.
   Typically these accounts require no passwords and do not require users
   to identify themselves. As a result such accounts are called
   &quot;anonymous&quot; accounts, and their users are considered &quot;anonymous&quot;
   users. In most configurations, all Lynx users (including anonymous
   users) are able to mail files to themselves and print the entire file
   to the screen.

   Additional print options are available for users who are using Lynx
   from their own accounts (that is, so-called &quot;non-anonymous users&quot;). In
   particular, the Save to a local file option allows you to save the
   document into a file on your disk space. Any number of additional
   print options may also be available as configured by your system
   administrator.

   Some options, such as Save to a local file, involve prompting for an
   output filename. All output filename entries are saved in a circular
   buffer, and any previous entries can be retrieved for re-use by
   pressing the up-arrow or down-arrow keys at the prompt.

   Note that if you want exact copies of text files without any
   expansions of TAB characters to spaces you should use the Download
   options. [ToC]

 Viewing the HTML document source and editing documents

   When viewing HTML documents it is possible to retrieve and display the
   unrendered (i.e., the original HTML) source of the document by
   pressing the '\' (backslash) key. The document must be reloaded from
   the server or disk to be displayed on the screen unrendered, since
   Lynx originally rendered what it received and does not still have it
   as source. When viewing unrendered documents you may print them as any
   normal document.

   Selecting the Print to a local file option from the Print Menu, makes
   it possible to save the source of the document to disk so that you may
   have a local copy of the document source, but it is better to Download
   the source.

   NOTE: When saving an HTML document it is important to name the
   document with a .html extension, if you want to read it with Lynx
   again later.

   Lynx can allow users to edit documents that reside on the local
   system. To enable editing, documents must be referenced using a
   &quot;file:&quot; URL or by specifying a plain filename on the command line as
   in the following two examples:

   Command
          lynx file://localhost/FULL/PATH/FILENAME
          lynx path/filename.html

   In addition, the user must also specify an editor in the Options Menu
   so that Lynx knows which editor to use. If the file is specified
   correctly and an editor is defined, then you may edit documents by
   using the 'e' command. When the 'e' command is entered your specified
   editor is spawned to edit the file. After changes are completed, exit
   your editor and you will return to Lynx. Lynx will reload and render
   the file so that changes can be immediately examined. [ToC]

 Downloading and Saving source files.

   If the DOWNLOAD keystroke command ('d' or D) is used when positioned
   on a link for an HTML, plain text, or binary file, Lynx will transfer
   the file, without rendering or modification, into a temporary location
   and present the user with a list of options, as when a link for a
   binary file of a type for which no viewer has been mapped is
   activated. As described above, the only default Download option is
   Save to disk, which is disabled if Lynx is running in anonymous mode,
   and any number of additional download methods such as kermit and
   zmodem may be defined in the lynx.cfg file by the system
   administrator. Downloading the sources of HTML and plain text files,
   instead of toggling to display the source ('\') and then using
   Printing options, ensures that no modifications of the source (e.g.,
   expansions of TAB characters to a series of spaces) will occur.

   Some options, such as Save to disk, involve prompting for an output
   filename. All output filename entries are saved in a circular buffer,
   and any previous entries can be retrieved for re-use by pressing the
   up-arrow or down-arrow keys at the prompt. [ToC]

 Reloading files and refreshing the display

   The RELOAD (Control-R) command will reload and re-render the file that
   you are currently viewing. The REFRESH (Control-L or Control-W)
   command will refresh or wipe the screen to remove or correct any
   errors that may be caused by operating system or other messages.

   The NOCACHE ('x' or 'X') command can be used in lieu of ACTIVATE
   (Return or right-arrow) to request an uncached copy and new rendition
   for the current link, or resubmission of a FORM, if a cache from a
   previous request or submission exits. The request or submission will
   include Pragma: no-cache and Cache-Control: no-cache in its headers.
   Note that FORMs with POST content will be resubmitted regardless of
   whether the NOCACHE or ACTIVATE command is used (see Lynx and HTML
   Forms). [ToC]

 Lynx searching commands

   Two commands activate searching in Lynx: '/' and 's'.

   While viewing a normal document use the '/' command to find a word or
   phrase within the current document. The search type will depend on the
   search option setting in the Options Menu. The search options are case
   sensitive and case insensitive. These searches are entirely local to
   Lynx.

   Some documents are designated index documents by virtue of an ISINDEX
   element in their HEAD section. These documents can be used to retrieve
   additional information based on searches using words or phrases
   submitted to an index server. The Lynx statusline will indicate that
   you are viewing such a document, and if so, the 's' key will invoke a
   statusline prompt to enter a query string. The prompt can be specified
   via a PROMPT attribute in the ISINDEX element. Otherwise, Lynx will
   use an internally configured prompt. The address for submitting the
   search can be specified via an HREF or ACTION attribute. Otherwise,
   Lynx will use the current document's URL and append your query string
   as a ?searchpart (see Supported URLs).

   All search words or strings which you have entered during a Lynx
   session are saved in a circular buffer, and can be retrieved for
   re-use by pressing the up-arrow or down-arrow keys at the prompt for a
   search word or string. Also, you can use the 'n'ext command to repeat
   a search with the last-entered search word or phrase, starting from
   the current position in the document. The word or phrase matches will
   be highlighted throughout the document, but such highlighting will not
   persist for new documents, or if the current document is reloaded. The
   search cycles to the top of the document if the word or phrase is not
   located below your current position.

   Although HTML Forms have largely replaced index documents for searches
   via http servers, they are still useful for performing searches
   directly via WAIS or Gopher servers in conjunction with the internal
   gateways for such servers. For example, an HTML index document can act
   as a cover page describing a WAIS database and how to formulate query
   strings for searching it, and include an element such as:
      &lt;ISINDEX PROMPT=&quot;Enter WAIS query:&quot;
               HREF=&quot;wais://net.bio.net/biologists-addresses&quot;&gt;
   for submitting a search of the Biologist's Addresses database directly
   to the net.bio.net WAIS server. [ToC]

 Lynx Options Menu

   The Lynx Options Menu may be accessed by pressing the 'o' key. The
   current Options Menu contains the following configurable options.

                      Options Menu

     E)ditor                      : emacs

   An option can be changed by entering the capital letter or character
   in parentheses for the option you wish to change (e.g. 'E' for Editor
   or '@' for show cursor). For fields where text must be entered, simply
   enter the text by typing on the keyboard. The Line Editor can be used
   to correct mistakes, and Control-U can be used to erase the whole
   line. When you are done entering a change press the Return key to get
   back to the Command? prompt.

   For fields where you must choose one of two choices, press any key to
   toggle the choices and press the Return key to finish the change.

   For fields where you potentially have more than two choices, popup
   windows may be evoked which function homologously to those for select
   fields in HTML Forms. The popup windows will be invoked only if you
   have popups for select fields set to ON (see below). Otherwise, your
   cursor will be positioned at the current choice, and you can press any
   key to cycle through the choices, then press the Return key to finish
   the change.

   When you are done changing options use

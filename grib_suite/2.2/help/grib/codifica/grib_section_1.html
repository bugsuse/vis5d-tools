SECTION 1: THE PRODUCT DEFINITION SECTION (PDS).

     The PDS contains indicators for the Parameter table Version, the
originating center, the numerical model (or &quot;generating process&quot;) that
created the data, the geographical area covered by the data, the
parameter itself, the values for the appropriate vertical level or
layer where the data reside, the decimal scale factor, and date/time
information.  The PDS is normally 28 octets long but it may be longer
if an originating center chooses to make it so.  Users of GRIB messages
are strongly urged to use the length-of-section portion of the PDS to
determine where the next section begins.  Never assume a fixed octet
length in this, or any other, section.

      29-40     Reserved (need not be present)

      41-...    Reserved for originating center use.

     Note: Octet 8 may indicate the presence of the Grid Description
Section (GDS) even though octet 7 specifies a predefined grid.  In this
case the GDS must describe that grid - this device serves as a
mechanism for transmitting new &quot;predefined&quot; grids to users prior to
their formal publication in this or the official WMO documentation.  It
is, however, the desired practice to always include the GDS in GRIB
bulletins.

     Another Note:  The use of octet 26 to indicate a &quot;sub-center&quot; is
not (yet) an officially sanctioned WMO practice.  The Manual indicates
the octet is to be &quot;reserved&quot;, and set to 0.  The use arises out of an
upcoming change in the Manual in which the &quot;originating centers&quot; for
both GRIB and BUFR (FM 94) will reference a single common table.  The
difficulty is that BUFR has two octets available for an originating
center number while GRIB has only one.  The compromise solution is to
allow the use of octet 26 as the &quot;second&quot; octet for GRIB, but only in a
national context.  The WMO will coordinate the assignment of the
numbers  for octet 5 for national and international centers (for both
GRIB and BUFR), while each national center will then be free to assign
sub-center numbers at will to be placed in the octet 26.  A zero value
in octet 26 will serve as the default indicating that there is no sub-
center associated with a particular center.  Table 0, in this document,
shows, in Part 1, a selection of the WMO recognized originating centers
(those that are currently active) as would be found in octet 5.

NOTES ON INTERNATIONAL EXCHANGE/FOS GRIDS:

     (i)    The grid points are laid out in a linear array such that
the longitude index (the columns) is the most rapidly varying.  For the
northern hemisphere grids the first point in the record is at the
intersection of the western-most meridian and southern-most circle of
latitude; the last point is the single polar value (see note iii,
below).  For the southern hemisphere grids the first point in the
record is the single polar value (see note iii, below); the last point
is at the intersection of the eastern-most meridian and northern-most
circle of latitude.  For those familiar with FORTRAN subscripting
conventions, longitude is the first subscript, latitude the second.

      (ii)   In grids 21 through 26, and 61 through 64, the values on
the shared boundaries are included in each area.

      (iii)  The datum for the pole point is given only once in each
grid.  The user must expand, if desired, the single pole point value to
all the pole &quot;points&quot; at the pole row of a latitude-longitude grid.
Scalar quantity values are the same for all pole points on a the grid.
Wind components at the poles are given by the formulae:

            u = -speed * sin(dd)   &amp;   v = -speed * cos(dd)

where dd is the direction of the wind as reported according to the
specification of wind direction at the poles (refer to WMO Manual
on Codes &lt;1&gt;, code table 878).

     The WMO convention can be given this operational definition:  At
the North Pole, face into the wind and report the value of the west
longitude meridian along which the wind is coming at you; at the South
Pole do likewise but report the east longitude meridian value. This is
equivalent to placing the origin of a right-handed Cartesian coordinate
system on the North Pole with the y-axis pointing to the prime (0
degree) meridian and the x-axis pointing to the 90 degrees west
meridian, and then resolving any vector wind at the pole point into
components along those axes.  At the South Pole the coordinate axes are
oriented such that the y-axis points toward 180 degrees west.  Those
components are the u- and v-values given as the single pair of pole
point winds in the GRIB format.

     In terms of a longitude/latitude grid these are the wind
components for the pole point at the 180 degree meridian.  For example,
on a 2.5x2.5 degree northern hemisphere grid (145x37 points), with the
abscissa along the equator and the ordinate along the prime meridian,
the transmitted north pole wind components are those that belong at the
gridpoint (73,37).  The wind components at the other grid points along
the pole row may be obtained through suitable rotation of the
coordinate system.  All the components at the pole row are, of course,
simply representations of the same vector wind viewed from differing
(rotated) coordinate systems.  In the southern hemisphere the analogous
situation holds; the single set of transmitted pole point wind
components belong at the gridpoint (73,1).

                       Global Coverage of Grids
                         Octants of the Globe

     In the figure the boxes indicate the location of the octants of
the globe, the numbers are the corresponding grid identification
numbers (PDS Octet 7), and the letters are the grid identification used
in the WMO Abbreviated Heading.

     The left and right meridional columns of each octant/grid are
shared with the neighbors.

      The basic grid point separation is 1.25x1.25 deg. on a
latitude/longitude array, but the grid is &quot;thinned&quot; by reducing the
number of points in each row as one goes northward (or southward) away
from the equator.  In GRIB terms, this is referred to as a &quot;quasi-
regular&quot; grid.

     The latitudinal increment is always 1.25 deg.; this results in 73
rows where the pole is included as a &quot;row&quot;, not a single gridpoint.

     The longitudinal spacing at the equator is also 1.25 deg.; thus
there will be 73 gridpoints at the equator in each octant.

     The number of points on each latitudinal row, other than the
equator, is given by (using FORTRAN notation):

           NPOINTS = IFIX(2.0 + (90.0/1.25) * COS(LATITUDE))

Thus at the pole there will be two gridpoints, one each at the
meridians that delineate the edges of the octant.  The formula was
worked out so that there is (approximately) equal geographic separation
between the grid points uniformly across the globe.

     Because of variations in precision and roundoff error in different
computers, the value of NPOINTS may vary by 1 at &quot;critical&quot; latitudes
when calculated on various hardware platforms.  Here is a table of the
exact values of NPOINTS as a function of latitude as used in the
internationally exchanged grids.  These numbers will, of course, be
found in the Grid Description Section of each GRIB bulletin.

     When all this is put together the result is that there are 3447
points of data actually transmitted in any individual GRIB bulletin
containing one octant of the globe.

     In the GRIB bulletins all of this information will be included in
the Grid Description Section (GDS); the GDS must be included in order

2 and Table C for the general description of the GDS; what follows are

     Note that the scanning direction is from the bottom (south edge)
to the top of the octant grids, regardless of the hemisphere.  Thus in
the northern hemisphere the first 73 data points (in the BDS) will be
the equatorial values and the last two will be the polar values.  The
PL counts in the GDS octets 33-178 will, of course, indicate contain
these numbers.

     In the southern hemisphere, the first two data points will be the
south pole values, and the last 73 points will be the equatorial
values.  Octets 33-34 in the GDS will contain &quot;2&quot;, octets 35-36 will
contain a &quot;3&quot;, and so on to octets 177-178 which will contain &quot;73&quot;.

Notes:

       1) By convention, downward net fluxes of radiation or other
               quantities are assigned negative values; upward net
               fluxes of radiation or other quantities are
               assigned positive values.

       2) Unidirectional flux values, where the direction of flow
               is indicated in the name of the parameter shall all
               have positive values irrespective of the direction
               of flow.  Net (vertical) fluxes shall be calculated
               by subtracting the downward flux values from the
               upward flux values.

       3) The u and v components of vector quantities are defined
               with reference to GDS Octet 17 and Table 7.
               However, if the GDS is not included in a message,
               then any wind components are assumed to be resolved
               relative to the grid specified in the PDS with u
               and v defined as positive in the direction of
               increasing x and y (or i and j) coordinates
               respectively.

       4) Provision is made for three types of spectra:

               1)   Direction and Frequency
               2)   Direction and radial number
               3)   Radial number and radial number

       5) Parameters 81 and 91 show the units as &quot;fraction&quot;, thus
               allowing for a range of coverage. It is up to the
               user to employ the D (power of ten) scaling to
               assure that the necessary precision is retained in
               the numeric values.

NOTES:

1)   For analysis products, or the first of a series of analysis
     products, the reference time (octets 13 to 17) indicates the valid
     time.

2)   For forecast products, or the first of a series of forecast
     products, the reference time indicates the valid time of the
     analysis upon which the (first) forecast is based.

3)   Initialized analysis products are allocated numbers distinct from
     those allocated to uninitialized analysis products.

4)   A value of 10 allows the period of a forecast to be extended over
     two octets; this accommodates extended range forecasts.

5)   Where products or a series of products are averaged or
     accumulated, the number involved is to be represented in octets 22-
     23 of Section 1, while any number missing is to be represented in
     octet 24.

6)   Forecasts of the accumulation or difference of some quantity (e.g.
     quantitative precipitation forecasts), indicated by values of 4 or
     5 in octet 21, have a product valid time given by the reference
     time + P2; the period of accumulation, or difference, can be
     calculated as P2 - P1.

     A few examples may help to clarify the use of Table 5:

     For analysis products P1 is zero and the time range indicator is
also zero; for initialized products (sometimes called &quot;zero hour
forecasts&quot;) P1 is zero, but octet 21 is set to 1.

     For forecasts, typically, P1 contains the number of hours of the
forecast (the unit indicator given in octet 18 would be 1) and octet 21
contains a zero.

     Value 51 allows for the identification of the most common
climatological entities.  With P1=0, it could represent (or identify)
the multiple year climatology of anything from daily means (or less) to
semi-annual means (or more, up to a full year). The assumption is that
all the available values within the basic period P2 are averaged
together. (An &quot;annual mean climatology&quot; would just be an average over
the total climatological period - Table 5, entry 3.)  P1=1 allows for a
diurnal sub-stratification of the data within the P2 period, such as 30-
year climatology of February mean 00Z temperature starting at a date
certain, or all the 12Z surface radiation fluxes averaged for all the
days in a season, or whatever.   If other sub-stratifications are
appropriate they could be identified by different values of P1.  No
others have been proposed at this time.

     Value 115 would be used, typically, for multiple day mean
forecasts, all derived from the same initial conditions.

     Value 117 would be used, typically, for Monte Carlo type
calculations: many forecasts valid at the same time from different
initial (reference) times.

      Averages, accumulations, and differences get a somewhat
specialized treatment.  If octet 21 (Table 5) has a value between 2 and
5 (inclusive) then the reference time + P1 is the initial date/time and
the reference time + P2 is the final date/time of the period over which
averaging or accumulation takes place.  If, however, octet 21 has a
value of 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 123, or 124 then P2 specifies
the time interval between each of the fields (or the forecast initial
times) that have been averaged or accumulated.  These latter values of
octet 21 require the quantities averaged to be equally separated in
time; the former values, 3 and 4 in particular, allow for irregular or
unspecified intervals of time between the fields that are averaged or
accumulated.

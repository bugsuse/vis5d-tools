## Vis5d-tools

### [vis5d](https://www.ssec.wisc.edu/~billh/vis5d.html)

Vis5D is a system for interactive visualization of large 5-D gridded data sets such as those produced by numerical weather models. One can make isosurfaces, contour line slices, colored slices, volume renderings, etc of data in a 3-D grid, then rotate and animate the images in real time. There's also a feature for wind trajectory tracing, a way to make text anotations for publications, support for interactive data analysis, etc.

### [WRF2Vis5d](https://www2.mmm.ucar.edu/wrf/src/wrf2vis5d.tar.gz) 
wrf_to_v5d is a tool to convert wrf netcdf output to compressed Vis5d files.

- Generate VIS5D files from WRF netCDF files
- ONLY WRF output files in netCDF format can be converted

### [h5util](https://github.com/NanoComp/h5utils)

h5utils is a set of utilities for visualization and conversion of scientific data in the free, portable HDF5 format.

Besides providing a simple tool for batch visualization as PNG images, h5utils also includes programs to convert HDF5 datasets into the formats required by other free visualization software (e.g. plain text, Vis5d, and VTK).

### [ARWPost](https://www2.mmm.ucar.edu/wrf/src/ARWpost.tar.gz)

The ARWpost package reads in WRF-ARW model data and creates output in either GrADS or Vis5D format.

### [grib2v5d](http://grib2v5d.sourceforge.net/)

The program grib2v5d converts the content of a GRIB file (a format used for exchanging meteorological model fields) into a file that can be viewed with Vis5d, a popular program for 3-D visualisation of meteorological fields. 

**required packages**

- [picogrib](https://sourceforge.net/projects/picogrib/files/)
- [gributil](https://sourceforge.net/projects/gributil/files/)


### [readglobe](http://grib2v5d.sourceforge.net/readglobe/readglobe.html)

Readglobe reads the GLOBE elevation dataset (and the its previous variants Etopo5 and EROS) available at NOAA and writes a Vis5d topography file on an arbitrary area of the world.

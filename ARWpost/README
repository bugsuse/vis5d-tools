ARWpost 
March 2010

	Bug fix to v5d output
March 2009
	Add extrapolation below ground for pressure output
October 2008
	Mode V3 compatible code
	Add lat-lon projection - cannot deal with roated lat-lon grids yet
	Add extrapolation option
	Add fix to ensure xlat/xlong are always available for projection calculations
March 2008
	V3 compatible
	Add td2 calculations
	Improved array handling, so that memory footprint is as small as possible
	Fix year on v5d plots
	Fix to datetamp on v5d plots
	Fix to v5d when truelat1=truelat2 (lambert projections)
October 2007
	Add diagnostic rh2
	When testing fields to see if we want them, make sure to 
	only tests fields with names longer than one character.
September 2007
        Add output splitting capabilities. 
        To split the output file (grads only), set 
		split_output = .true.
        By default the file will be split into 1 time per output file.
   	But the number of frames in the output file can be controlled with:
 		frames_per_outfile = 2
	This is code adapted from some send in by:
		Hara, Masayuki (Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology)
	Add fix to vis5d computation of projection arguments for lambert and mercator
	Add some debug printout
August 2007
	Add tacc to allow for some time drifting
June 2007
	Add cloud fractions
	Remove memory leaks
November 2006

The program read any wrf dataset in NETCDF/GRIB1 format and can produce either
GrADS input data format or Vis5D input format.

WRFV2 MUST be compiled and avaliable. If WRFV2 is not on the same level as 
ARWpost, then configure.arwp needs to be edited to correct path.


COMPILE
	./configure  --- to get a list of compile options for your computer
		         If your computer is not listed, you will need to add it under
			 arch/configure.defaults
	./compile    --- compile the code

	./clean -a   --- clean

	TO ADD DIAGNOSTICS
		First make sure that all the arrays needed for the calculations are 
		available. The following are carried NOW.
		XLAT, XLONG, HGT, PSFC, P, PB, PH, PHB, QV, T(theta-300), TT(temp in K from metdata)
		U10, V10, UUU, VVV (if keep_wind_arrays = TRUE)
		QR, QS, QG (if keep_moist_arrays = TRUE)

		Logical variables have_* indicate if arrays are present.

		See src/module_model_basics.f90, and src/module_arrays.f90

		Create a new module (module_calc_*.f90) which will calculate the new
		diagnostic variable. Look at one of the existing ones for an example.

		Add CALL to src/module_diagmostics.f90
			Must call the following 3 routines
				CALL calc_* (new diagnostics)
				CALL interp (to interpolate to output grid)
				CALL write_dat (to write output)

		Make appropriate changes to the Makefile

		If a new 3D diagnostical field had been created, AND Vis5D output are
		going to be generated, this new field must also be added to "known_3d_fields"
		in src/v5d_module.f90

		
Special NOTES:
Vis5D output, cannot have 'plot = "all"'

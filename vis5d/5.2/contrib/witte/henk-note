Dear Bill,
Last week I uploaded the following files, I hope they are useful:
 
Make_map      make for the vector to vis5dmap utility
Make_tov5d    make for the to vis5d data conversion
Make_ccrutil  make for extra utilities
ccm_to_v5d.c  source of the dataconversion program
scanccr.c     source of a program that lists the variables/levels/timesteps
              in a ccr file
extrccr.c     source of a program to extract an area of the ccr output
diffccr.c     source of a program that calculates differences between
              two ccr files
ccrutil.h     include file for the ccm_to_v5d.c program and other utilities
ccmheader     example header used by the ccm_to_v5d program and other utilities
vec_to_map.c  source of the vector to vis5dmap program
ccrutil.readme  readme file for dataconversion program and other utilities
vectomap.readme readme file for the vec_to_map program
 
I also have a program to convert the CCM landmasks to vector format, but
the masks need to be manipulated first by hand. Also, although the program
works with all masks I have tried until now, I do not think it is ready
for use by others. I am willing however to see if I can "vectorise" masks
if needed. Also I can send the maps I have of the CCM simulations
to Rich Selin.
 
Hope it all works!
Best, Henk.

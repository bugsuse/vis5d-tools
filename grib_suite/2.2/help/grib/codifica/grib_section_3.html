SECTION 3: BIT MAP SECTION (BMS).

     The purpose of the (optional) BMS is to provide either a bit map
or a reference to a bit map pre-defined by the center.  The bit map
consists of contiguous bits with a bit-to-data-point correspondence as
defined in the grid description.  A bit set equal to 1 implies the
presence of a datum for that grid point in the BDS; a value of zero
implies the absence of such.  This is useful in shrinking fields where
fair portions of the field are not defined.  An example would be global
grids of sea surface temperature; the bit map would be used to suppress
the &quot;data&quot; at grid points over land.  One would not want to use the BMS
if the data were un-defined at only a small number of grid points as
the overhead of adding the bit map array (one bit for each grid point)
might add more bits to the overall message that were subtracted by the
removal of a few data values.

     Octet no.

      1 - 3       Length in octets of Bit Map Section

      4           Number of unused bits at end of Section 3.

      5 - 6       Numeric:

                  = 0:        a bit map follows;
                  otherwise:  the numeric refers to a
                              predefined bit map provided
                              by the center

      7 - nnn     Bit map, zero filled to an even number of octets

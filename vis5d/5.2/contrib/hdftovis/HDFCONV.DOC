My problems with the HDF to vis5d converting to HP

MAKEFILE

compal.f is no longer available with vis5d.  Karen Butler 
(butler@geosim.msfc.nasa.gov) supplied it very promptly (I hope this is her
current internet address).

[NOTE: compal.c is the file needed and is now included.  -Brian]


the HP chose to ignore the compile option of -k and got very nasty about the
libdf.a from a SGI.  The libdf.a was probably also HDF 3.2.
The libraries are available at ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu  in /HDF/HDF4.0r1/BIN.  
Change the 4.0r1 to whatever version you prefer.  I am using 3.3r4.  The HP HDF
library was built for a 755, but it seemed to be OK on my 715.  I have since 
built it on the 715, with no apparent difference in operation.

The HP did not seem affected by changing the .F to .f though they do have 
different meanings.  Unfortunately I dont have access to SGI manuals to see if
there were any differences there.

For reasons unknown, args.o refused to be recognized in the build, so to reduce
the number of unknowns, I put the command line handling in the hdftovis.F 
program.

SOURCE CODE : HDFTOVIS

INTEGER*1 is not in the HP FORTRAN compiler.  I replaced it with BYTE which is 
defined to range from -128 to +127.  LOGICAL*1 may also work, but I could not
find a convincing definition.  

The biggest problem I had, was the uncertainty of making a lot of changes
without knowing if they were correct.  What caused almost all of my problems
turned out to result from over zealous removal of HDF C function declarations
which(with some other things) were causing dozens of warnings on the HP.
Although there are a full set of FORTRAN function names, the C declarations 
do work in FORTRAN.
The HDF functions must be declared because they start with "D" but return
integers.   As I have probably never coded a FORTRAN function call, I did not
think of the typical FORTRAN default to float applying to functions.  

There may be more small changes, but because of the number of small changes 
I made to get rid of the warnings, a "diff" has turned out to be surprisingly 
hard to follow.

TEST DATA         

The test data file generator in the README.HDF file only demonstrated a single 
time step.  I did one which shows a trivial change over time for the two 
variables.  I would be glad to send it.

RESULTS

Unfortunately, I now have the dubious distinction of being the local HP FORTRAN
expert.  I still dont know enough about HDF to do what I set out to do.
Karen Butler was wonderful about answering my strange questions which, 
of course, had nothing to do with the real problem--my removing ALL of the 
HDF declarations.

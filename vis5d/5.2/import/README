1. Introduction

The goals of the Vis5D Data Import program (v5dimport) are:

    1. Convert various grid file formats to Vis5D format.
    2. Resample data to new coordinate systems.
    3. Combine data from multiple source files.
    4. Catagorically select grids for resampling and output.

As an example, you may use v5dimport to read 2 McIDAS GR3D files and a
2-D McIDAS GRID file, resample all the data to a Lambert Conformal proj-
ection, omit the CWAT and VORT variables and then write the data to a
Vis5D file called lambert1.v5d.


The basic order of events when using v5dimport is:

    1. Read the input file(s).
    2. Select grids for output according to timestep, physical variable,
       map projection or vertical coordinate system.
    3. Setup a map projection and vertical coordinate system for the
       output file.
    4. Write the output file, doing resampling as needed.
    5. Optionally, start Vis5D on the output file.


If you have any problems or questions about v5dimport contact Brian Paul
(brianp@ssec.wisc.edu) or Bill Hibbard (whibbard@macc.wisc.edu) for help.



2. Using v5dimport

v5dimport has both an X-based graphical interface and a text (type-in)
interface.  The command line syntax is:

	v5dimport [-t] [-path pathname] [files]

The X interface is the default.  To run v5dimport in text mode use the -t
option.  You may specify a list if input files on the command line.

Using the text interface it's possible to run v5dimport with a script by
using your shell's import redirection feature:

	v5dimport -t <script

An optional directory name may be specified with the -path parameter.
This directory is used as the default, in place of the current directory,
for the input file browser and for making output files.

The next sections describe how to use v5dimport in each mode.




3. Using v5dimport's graphical interface

3.1 Reading input files

After v5dimport has started you can read input files by clicking on the
"Read file..." button.

A summary of all 3-D grids sorted by time and variable name will be shown
in the main window.  You can scroll through the list to inspect the grids.
The columns in this list are:

	Grid - grid number (no significant meaning)
	YYDDD - the year and date of the grid
	HHMMSS - the time of the grid in hours, minutes, and seconds
	Variable - the variable name
	Nr - number of grid rows
	Nc - number of grid columns
	Nl - number of grid levels
	Proj# - the projection number (see "Select by projection..." window)
	VCS# - the vertical coordinate system number (see "Select by VCS...")
	Filename - name of file the grid was found in


3.2 Select grids for output

It's often the case that one wants to omit certain variables or timesteps
from the output file.  By default, all grids are selected for output.

To select physical variables, click on the "Select by variable..." button.
A window will appear in which you can click on variable names to select or
deselect them.

Similarly, you can select timesteps via the "Select by time..." button.

You can also select grids according to their map projection or vertical
coordinate system via the "Select by projection..." and "Select by VCS..."
buttons.

As you select/deselect timesteps, variables, projections, or VCSs the
effected grids will be high-lighted/unhigh-lighted in the main grid list.

The "Discard all grids" button is used to restart you v5dimport session
with exiting and restarting.


3.3 Define the output file

v5dimport will try to find reasonable defaults for the output file's
grid size, map projection, and vertical coordinate system but you will
often have to change them yourself.

The number of rows, columns, and levels for the output file is specified
by the type-in fields on the main window.

The map projection for the output file can be viewed and changed by clicking
on the "Map projection..." button.  In this pop-up window you'll be able
to choose a map projection type then enter the specific projection parameters.
There is also a "Guess" button which will attempt to find a reasonable
output projection given the currently selected grid list.

The vertical coordinate system for the output file can be viewed and changed
by clicking on the "Vertical Coord System..." button.  In this pop-up window
you'll be able to choose a vertical coordinate system type and enter the
specific parameters.  This window also has a "Guess" button to try to find
a reasonable default.


3.4 Make the output file

Type a filename for the output file in the type-in field at the bottom of
the main window then click on "Make".  Messages will be printed as the
file conversion takes place.

Click on the "Exit" button when you're all done.


3.5 Visualize the output file

Click on "Visualize".  This will make the file and then start up Vis5D
on that file (i.e., you don't need to click on "Make" first).  If you
type a filename in the type-in field, it wil use that name.  Otherwise,
it will use your login name followed by ".v5d".

If you want command line options on the Vis5D command, put them in a
file named "vis5d_options".  For example, "-mbs 64".


3.6 Miscellaneous

An options window is available by clicking on the "Options..." button.

The first item controls the "combining of co-located data".  It may be the
case that several 3-D grids, selected for output, are co-located in space
and time.  When computing the value to put in the output file you can either
choose the data value from the higher resolution grid at that location, or
take the average of all grid values at that grid location.

The second item controls how grid data is compressed in the output file.
By default, grid values are scaled down to 1-byte integers.  Alternately,
you can scale down to 2-byte integers for better resolution, or perform no
compression/scaling by selecting 4-byte floating point values.  This option
respresents a tradeoff in file size and precision.




4. Using v5dimport's text interface

The text/type-in interface to v5dimport is useful when X is not available
or when you want to run v5dimport with a script.

4.1 Interactive use

After you've invoked v5dimport with the -t option you'll see a >> prompt
at which you can issue any of these commands:

    exit       - exit v5dimport
    help       - online help
    list       - show lists of grids, timesteps, variables, map projections,
                 or vertical coordinate systems.
    read       - read an input file
    keep/omit  - used to select which grids, according to timestep, variable,
                 map projection or vcs, are to be included in or omitted from
                 the output file.
    info       - display parameters of output file
    rows       - specify number of grid rows for output file
    columns    - specify number of grid columns for output file
    levels     - specify max number of grid levels for output file
    projection - specify the output file's map projection
    vertical   - specify the output file's vertical coordinate system
    make       - make the output file
    visualize  - make the output file and start Vis5D

Using the text interface to v5dimport is similar in strategy to the graphical
interface:
    1. Read input files
    2. Select grids by timestep, variable, projection, and/or VCS:
          This is typically done by a series of list, omit, and keep
          commands.
    3. Set/adjust output file parameters:
          Typically a series of info, rows, columns, levels, projection,
          and vertical commands.
    4. Make the output file, OR ...
       Make the output file and start Vis5D.

Use the help command to learn the exact syntax for each command.

4.2 Scripts

You can operate v5dimport with a script using your shell's input redirection
operator:

    v5dimport -t <script [files]

where "script" is an ASCII file of v5dimport commands and [files] is an
optional list of input files.

As v5dimport executes a script it prints each command and its result.

Script lines which start with a # are considered comments and ignored.




APPENDIX A:  Implementation Notes (for programmers only)

Look for the comment /*** ADD NEW FORMATS HERE ***/ to see where code
has to be added to support a new file format.


The symbol EPA is defined on the cc command line with -DEPA only on
systems which can read EPA files.  Currently, only Cray systems can
read EPA files because the EPA-provided file reading functions only
work on Cray computers.

The symbol MCIDAS is defined on the cc command line with -DMCIDAS only on
systems which can use the libmcidas.a file.  Only SGI's in 32-bit mode
are supported now.


The basic order of operations is:

Read input files:
    FOREACH input file DO
	Read file header
	FOREACH grid in the file DO
	    Construct a grid_info struct for the grid
	    Add the grid_info to the gridlist
	ENDDO
    ENDDO

Build a grid table from the grid list.  The grid table is a 2-D table
indexed by timestep and variable number which points to grid_info structs.

Enter GUI loop:
    User selects timesteps, variable, sets projection parameters, etc.

Write output file:
    Examine the grid table to determine which timesteps, variables, etc
       are selected for output.
    FOREACH grid selected for output DO
        Resample the grid to the output file's coordinate system if necessary
        write the grid to the v5d file
    ENDDO

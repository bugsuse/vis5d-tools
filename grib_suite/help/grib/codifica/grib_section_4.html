SECTION 4: BINARY DATA SECTION (BDS).

     The BDS contains the packed data and the binary scaling
information needed to reconstruct the original data from the packed
data.  The required decimal scale factor is found in the PDS, above.
The data stream is zero filled to an even number of octets.

     Octet no.

      1 - 3       Length in octets of binary data section

     4          Bits 1 through 4: Flag - See Table 11
                Bits 5 through 8: Number of unused bits at end
                                 of Section 4.

     5 - 6      The binary scale factor (E).  A negative value
                is indicated by setting the high order bit
                (bit No. 1) in octet 5 to 1 (on).

      7 - 10      Reference value (minimum value); floating
                  point representation of the number.

      11          Number of bits into which a datum point is
                  packed

     12 -nnn      Variable, depending on octet 4;
                  zero filled to an even number of octets.

     14           Optionally, may contain an extension of the flags in
                  octet 4.  See Table 11.


     Here are some of the various forms the binary data can take; the
flag table in BDS octet 4, possibly extended into octet 14, identifies
which variant is in use.

     Grid-point data - Simple packing

     Here the data simply begin in octet 12 and continue, packed
according to the simple packing algorithm described above, without any
particular regard for computer &quot;word&quot; boundaries, until there is no
more data.  There may be some &quot;zero-fill&quot; bits at the end.

     If all the data in a grid point field happen to have the same
value, then all of the deviations from the reference value are set to
zero.  Since a zero value requires no bits for packing, octet 11 is set
to zero, thus indicating a field of constant data, the value of which
is given by the reference value.  Under these circumstances, octet 12
is set to zero (the required &quot;zero fill to an even number of octets&quot;)
and bits 5-8 of octet 4 contain an 8.  The number of data points in the
field is implied by the grid identification given in the PDS and/or the
GDS and BMS.

     Spherical Harmonic Coefficients - Simple packing

     Octets 12-15 contain the real part of the (0.0) coefficient in the
same floating point format as the reference value in octets 7-10.  The
imaginary part of the (0.0) coefficient, mathematically, is always
equal zero.  Octets 16 to the end contain the remaining coefficients
packed up as binary data with the same sort of scaling, reference
value, and the like, as with grid-point numbers.  Excluding the (0,0)
coefficient, which is usually much larger than the others, from the
packing operation means that the remaining coefficients can be packed
to a given precision more efficiently (fewer bits per word) than would
be the case otherwise.

     Grid-Point Data - Second Order or Complex Packing

     Before laying out where the various second order values, sub-
parameters, counters, and what have you, go, it is appropriate to
describe the second order packing method in an algorithmic manner.

     Referring back to the description of simple packing, the encoding
method is the same up to part way through the fourth step, stopping
just short of the actual packing of the scaled integers into the
&quot;words&quot; of either a pre-specified or calculated bit length.

     The basic outline of second order packing is to scan through the
array of integers (one per grid point, or possibly less than that if
the Bit Map Section has been employed to discard some of the null value
points) and seek out sub-sections exhibiting relatively low variability
within the sub-section.  One then finds the (local) minimum value in
that sub-section and subtracts it from the (&quot;first order&quot;) integers in
that sub-section, which leave a set of &quot;second order&quot; integers.  These
numbers are then scanned to find the maximum value, which in turn is
used to specify the minimum bit width for a &quot;word&quot; necessary to contain
the sub-section set of second order numbers.

     The term &quot;first order&quot; in this context refers to the integer
variables that result from subtracting the overall (global) minimum
from the original variables and then doing all scaling and rounding;
&quot;second order&quot; refers to the variables that result from subtracting the
local minimum from the sub-set of first order variables.  No further
scaling is necessary or appropriate.

     The sub-section set of numbers are then packed into &quot;words&quot; of the
just determined bit length.  The overall savings in space comes about
because the second order values are, usually, smaller than their first
order counterparts.  They have, after all, had two minima subtracted
from the original values, the overall minimum and the local minimum,
where the first order values have had only the overall minimum
subtracted out.  There is no guarantee, however, that the second order
packing will compress a given field to a greater degree than the first
order packing.  If the first order field of integers is highly
variable, or generally close to zero, then there will be no gain in
compression.  But if the field shows long runs of small variation,
particularly if some of the runs are constant (zero variability), then
the second order packing will contribute to the compression.

     The process then repeats and a whole collection of sub-sections
are found, their local minima are subtracted, etc.  One of the tricky
parts of this process is defining just what is meant by a &quot;sub-section
of low variability&quot;.  The WMO Manual is silent on this as it only
describes how the sub-sections and their ancillary data are to be
packed in the message.  The U.S. National Weather Service, the U.K.
Meteorological Office, the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather
Forecasts, and probably other groups have, independently, designed
selection criteria and built them into GRIB encoders.  It is beyond the
scope of this document to attempt to describe them in any detail.
These groups have all expressed their willingness to share their GRIB
encoders with any who ask for them.

     Before laying out where the second order values, etc., are placed
in a message, we had best review just what information has to be saved.
We need to include the following information:

          1)   How many sub-sections there are;

          2)   Where does each sub-section begin;

          3)   Where does each sub-section end; or,
               how many data points are in each sub-section;

          4)   What is the local minimum value (a first order value)
               that was found for each sub-section;

          5)   What is the bit width of the collection of first order
               values (the local minima) found for each sub-section;

          6)   What are the second order values for each sub-section;

          7)   What are the bit widths of the second order values
               appropriate for all the sub-section; and, finally,

          8)   Sufficient information to specify where the above
               information is located.

     A moments consideration (a long moment, perhaps) will satisfy the
reader that the information given will be sufficient to reconstruct the
original data field.

     The information needed for points 2) and 3), the beginning and end
of the sub-sections, is presented in the form of a bit map, called a
&quot;secondary bit map&quot; to distinguish it from the bit map (optionally)
contained in the BMS.  There is one bit for each grid point containing
data, ordered in the same way as the grid is laid out.  The &quot;primary&quot;
bit map, the BMS bit map, may have been used to eliminate data at
points where the data are meaningless - only the remaining &quot;real&quot; data
points are matched by the bits in the secondary bit map.  This
possibility is understood to exist throughout the following discussion.
The start of each sub-section is indicated by the corresponding bit set
to &quot;on&quot; or to a value of 1.  Clearly, the first bit in the secondary
bit map will always be set on, since the first data point must be the
start of the first sub-section.  (If it is not, then something is wrong
somewhere.  Unfortunately it is not always easy to tell just where the
error occurred.)  The secondary bit map is then no more than a
collection of 1s and 0s, indicating the start and the extent of each
sub-section.  It would be possible to scan through the secondary bit
map and determine how many sub-sections there are; however, this number
is explicitly included in the GRIB message to save one the trouble, and
to serve as an internal self-checking mechanism.

     At long last, then, here is the layout of the information, with
further explanatory notes, when second order packing has been employed:

   Octet no.       Content

     1-3         Length in octets of binary data section

     4           Bits 1 through 4: Flag - See Table 11
                 Bits 5 through 8: Number of unused bits at end of
                 Section 4.

     5-6         The binary scale factor (E).  A negative value
                 is indicated by setting the high order bit(bit No. 1)
                 in octet 5 to 1 (on).

     7-10        Reference value (minimum value); floating point
                 representation of the number.  This is the overall or
                 &quot;global&quot; minimum that has been subtracted from all
                 the values.

     11          Number of bits into which a datum point is packed.
                 This width now refers to the collection of first
                 order packed values that serve as the local minimum
                 values, one for each sub-section.  It is determined
                 in the same manner as for the simple (first order)
                 packing.

     12-13       N1 - Octet number, relative to the start of the BDS,
                 at which the collection of first order packed numbers
                 begins, i.e. the collection of local minimum values.

     14          The flags that are an extension of octet 4.  See Code
                 Table 11.

     15-16       N2 - Octet number, relative to the start of the BDS,
                 at which the collection of second order packed
                 numbers begins.

     17-18       P1 - The number of first order packed values, the
                 local minima.  This number is the same as the number
                 of sub-sections.

     19-20       P2 - The number of second order packed values
                 actually in the message.  This is the number of
                 actual data points as (possibly) modified by the bit
                 map in the BMS, if any, and/or reduced by the number
                 of identical points collapsed together by the run-
                 length encoding (see below)

     21          Reserved

     22-(xx-1)   Width(s), in bits, of the second order packed values;
                 each width value is contained in 1 octet.  There are
                 as many width values, or octets, as there are sub-
                 sections, P1 of them.  However, there may be but one
                 such value under special circumstances; see below.
                 Also, the width value for a particular sub-section
                 may perfectly well be zero.

     xx-(N1-1)     Secondary bit map, one bit for each data point.  It
                 will be P2 bits long, then padded to an even number
                 of octets with binary 0.

     N1-(N2-1)   P1 first order packed values, the local minima, each
                 held in a &quot;word&quot; of bit-length found in octet 11,
                 then padded to a whole number of octets with 0s.

     N2-...      P2 second order packed values.  There is no &quot;marking&quot;
                 of the sub-sections here; all the sub-section second
                 order values are placed in a continuous string of
                 bits.  The bit-length of the &quot;words&quot; holding the
                 values will change from place to place but again this
                 has to be determined by reference to the other
                 information.

                 As usual, there may be padding by binary 0 bits
                 sufficient to bring the entire section to an even
                 number of octets.

     There are a small number of special cases and variations on the
above layout:

     If the bit-width for a sub-section is zero, then no second order
values for that sub-section are included in the part of the message
starting at octet N2.  The value of P2 will reflect the absence of
those points.  This will happen is all the first order values in the
sub-section are identical.  This is a form of &quot;run-length encoding&quot; and
contributes greatly to packing efficiency if the original data contains
strings of constant value (including zero).

     Under some circumstances, it may turn out that there is no need to
use different bit-widths for each of the sub-sections.  In that case, a
flag is set in bit 8 of the extended flags found in octet 14 (see table
11) indicating that all the sub-sections are packed with the same bit-
width, and that the single value will be found in octet 22.

     Row by row packing is defined as selecting entire rows (or
columns) to serve as sub-sections, without regard to &quot;variability&quot;
determinations.  It can have some compression value.  If row by row
packing is employed, this is indicated by setting a flag in bit 7 of
the extended flags found in octet 14 (see table 11) and NOT including
the secondary bit map in the message.  It is unnecessary since the
length of the rows (columns) is known from the grid specifications
given elsewhere in the message.

                           TABLES FOR THE BDS


                            TABLE 11.  FLAG
                   (BDS Octet 4 and, optionally, 14)


         Bit     Value      Meaning



          1       0      Grid point data
                  1      Spherical Harmonic Coefficients

          2       0      Simple packing
                  1      Second order (&quot;Complex&quot;) Packing

          3       0      Original data were floating point values
                  1      Original data were integer values

          4       0      No additional flags at octet 14
                  1      Octet 14 contains flag bits 5 - 12

The following gives the meaning of the bits in octet 14 ONLY if bit 4
is set to 1.  Otherwise octet 14 contains regular binary data.

          5              Reserved (set to 0)

          6       0      Single datum at each grid point
                  1      Matrix of values at each grid point

          7       0      No secondary bit maps
                  1      Secondary bit maps present

          8       0      Second order values have constant width
                  1      Second order values have different widths

          9-12           Reserved (set to 0)

Notes:

     (1)  Bit 3 is set to 1 to indicate that the original data were
          integers; when this is the case any non-zero reference values
          should be rounded to an integer value prior to placing in the
          GRIB BDS.

     (2)  Bit 4 is set to 1 to indicate that bits 5 to 12 are contained
          in octet 14 of the data section.

     (3)  Although GRIB is not capable of representing a matrix of data
          values at each grid point, the meaning of bit 6 is retained
          in anticipation of a future capability.

     (4)  When secondary bit maps are present in the data (used in
          association with second order packing) this is indicated by
          setting bit 7 to 1.

     (5)  When octet 14 contains the extended flag information octets
          12 and 13 will also contain &quot;special&quot; information; the actual
          data will begin in a subsequent octet.  See above.

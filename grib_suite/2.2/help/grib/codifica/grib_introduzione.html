INTRODUCTION

     The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) Commission for Basic
Systems (CBS) Extraordinary Meeting Number VIII (1985) approved a
general purpose, bit-oriented data exchange format, designated FM 92-
VIII Ext. GRIB (GRIdded Binary).  It is an efficient vehicle for
transmitting large volumes of gridded data to automated centers over
high speed telecommunication lines using modern protocols.  By packing
information into the GRIB code, messages (or records - the terms are
synonymous in this context) can be made more compact than character
oriented bulletins, which will produce faster computer-to-computer
transmissions.  GRIB can equally well serve as a data storage format,
generating the same efficiencies relative to information storage and
retrieval devices.

     Changes and extensions to GRIB were approved at the regular
meeting of the WMO/CBS in February, 1988; additional changes were
introduced at the CBS/WGDM/Sub-Group on Data Representation (SGDR)
meetings in May 1989 and in October 1990.  The 1990 changes were of
such structural magnitude as to require a new Edition of GRIB, Edition
1, which this document describes.  Further augmentations and
interpretations were made by the SGDR in September 1993, with approval
by the WGDM in February 1994. These changes did not result in a new
Edition to GRIB, but did change some of the Tables, resulting a new
Version number for them.  This brings us now to Table Version 2.  The
changes from Version 1 were mainly additions of new parameters or more
precise definition of existing ones.

     It is not anticipated that there will be any large-scale
structural changes to GRIB for at least four to five years, or more.
The SGDR is undertaking a thorough review of the present and future
requirements that GRIB is supposed to satisfy.  The plan is to design a
major revision of GRIB capable of accommodating these requirements and
more, without &quot;straining&quot; the structure of the data representation
form.  Some things are getting a little strained even now.  See below.

     Note: the Edition number is placed in the same location, relative
to the start of the GRIB message, for all Editions. Thus, decoding
programs can detect which Edition was used to construct a particular
GRIB message and behave accordingly.  This is useful for archives of
messages encoded in earlier Editions or during transition periods.  Of
course, this requires that data centers retain copies of older editions
of the code, and older versions of the parameter tables.

     Each GRIB record intended for either transmission or storage
contains a single parameter with values located at an array of grid
points, or represented as a set of spectral coefficients, for a single
level (or layer), encoded as a continuous bit stream.  Logical
divisions of the record are designated as &quot;sections&quot;, each of which
provides control information and/or data.  A GRIB record consists of
six sections, two of which are optional:

               (0) Indicator Section

               (1) Product Definition Section (PDS)

               (2) Grid Description Section (GDS) -  optional

               (3) Bit Map Section (BMS)          -  optional

               (4) Binary Data Section (BDS)

               (5) '7777' (ASCII Characters)

     Although the Grid Description Section is indicated as optional, it
is highly desirable that it be included in all messages.  That way
there will be no question about just what is the &quot;correct&quot; geographical
grid for a particular field.

     In this documentation, certain symbols are used to clarify the
contents of octets (groups of eight consecutive binary bits).  If
unadorned letters are used, they are symbolic and their meanings are
described in the text; a decimal number is simply printed as is; a
character or string of characters is represented inside single quote
marks.  International Alphabet No. 5, which is identical in its
essential elements to the U.S. National Standard 7-bit ASCII, is used
for character representation in the GRIB code.

     Octets are numbered consecutively from the start of each section;
bits within an octet are also numbered from left (the most significant
bit) to right (the least significant bit).  Thus an octet with bit 8
set to the value 1 would have the integer value 1; bit 7 set to one
would have a value of 2, etc.

     The numbering of Tables in the following text corresponds to the
description of GRIB in the WMO Manual on Codes&lt;1&gt;.  Some additional
tables not found in the WMO Manual are indicated by letters.  These,
generally, contain information unique to a particular processing
center.

     A caveat:  The Official International Documentation for GRIB is
the just referenced Manual on Codes.  This document is, in part,
intended to be a guide to the use of GRIB and may not include all of
the features currently found in the Manual.  The features described
here are intended to be a completely consistent sub-set of the full WMO
documentation; if there are any discrepancies the Manual on Codes is
the final authority.


DATA PACKING METHODS.

     The code form represents numeric data as a series of binary digits
(bits).  Such data representation is independent of any particular
machine representation; by convention data lengths are measured in
octets.  Data are coded as binary integers using the minimum number of
bits required for the desired precision.  Numeric values, with units as
shown in Table 2, may first be scaled by a power of ten to achieve an
appropriate decimal precision, a reference value is subtracted from
them to reduce redundancy and eliminate negative values, and they may
then be further scaled by a power of two to pack them into a pre-
selected word length.  The two scaling operations are independent;
which, or both, are used in any given case depends upon choices made as
to the method of packing.  See below.

     The representation of a single value is such that:

                        Y * 10D = R + (X * 2E)

     where

     Y = original or unpacked value; units as in Table 2;
     D = decimal scale factor, to achieve desired precision
               (sign bit, followed by a 15-bit integer);
     R = reference value (32 bits);
     X = internal value (No. of bits varies for each record);
     E = binary scale factor for variable bit word length packing
               (sign bit, followed by a 15-bit integer).


     The reference value (R) is the minimum value of the (possibly)
decimally scaled data that is being encoded.

     R is placed in the Binary Data Section in four octets as a single
precision floating-point number:

                  sAAAAAAA BBBBBBBB BBBBBBBB BBBBBBBB

          where s = sign bit, encoded as   0 =&gt; positive
                                           1 =&gt; negative
                A = 7-bit binary integer, the characteristic
                B = 24-bit binary integer, the mantissa.

     The appropriate formula to recover the value of R is:

                   R = (-1)s * 2(-24) * B * 16(A-64)

     This formula is the standard IBM representation for a single
precision (real) floating point number.  (Consideration is being given
to using the IEEE floating point representation in the future, in a
later Edition of GRIB.)

     If second order (or &quot;complex&quot;) packing is used (see the
description of that later on) the internal value, X, will be made up of
two values, a &quot;local minimum value&quot;, Xi, and a &quot;second order packed
value&quot;, Xj.  There will be one Xj for each grid point and a variable
number of Xi values.  This will all come clear later on when we get to
the description of second-order packing.

     What follows is a description, slightly simplified, of the process
that one would go through to pack a (meteorological) field into a GRIB
message, using &quot;simple packing&quot;.  It includes some explanations of why
certain steps are taken, some of the consequences, and what choices
have to be made.  Some of the choices are interrelated; the
relationships should be clear when the explanation is done.  The
additional features of complex or &quot;second order&quot; packing will be dealt
with in a later section.

     Give that a full field is available, the first step, if necessary,
is to convert the units of the parameter into those shown in Table 2,
the SI standard units, also known as the mks system.  Some of the units
may seem a little peculiar (kg/m2, for example, for precipitation - 1
kg/m2 is equivalent to a water depth of 1 mm); others may seem
inappropriate (Pa for pressure, for example, implies substantially
greater precision than is typical in meteorological usage; inverse
seconds are not nearly precise enough for divergence and vorticity) but
they are all self consistent.  The precision of the parameters, as
actually packed in a message, can be set to any desired degree through
the appropriate use of the power-of-10 (&quot;D&quot;) scaling and the power-of-2
(&quot;E&quot;) scaling.  Just how this comes about will be described
momentarily.

     At this point there is a choice to be made.  If it is desired to
use a pre-selected bit word length for the packed variables, then just
proceed on to the next step.  However, if a variable bit word length is
to be used, where the word length is adjusted to accommodate the data
values, then it is necessary to undertake the power-of-ten scaling.
The D value should be selected such that, when the original data, in
the SI units of Table 2, is multiplied by 10D, the integer part of the
result will have enough precision to contain all the appropriate
information of the variable.  Anticipating things a little bit, the
(scaled) value will be rounded to an integer as a part of the packing
process; thus the &quot;significant part&quot; of the value of the variable has
to be moved to the left of the decimal point prior to the rounding.
Temperature might be scaled with D=1, thus changing the units to deci-
degrees; pressure, on the other hand, might be scaled with D=-2, thus
actually reducing the precision to hectoPascals (mb), a more reasonable
meteorological precision; vorticity would be scaled up by D=8, and so
on.

     The second step in the packing operation is to scan through the
field, which may or may not have been &quot;D-scaled&quot; at this point, find
the minimum value of the parameter, and subtract that minimum - the
reference value, R - from all the data points, leaving a residual of
non-negative numbers.  This step has two benefits.  The first of these
is convenience -  making all the data points non-negative bypasses
problems with different computer hardware that represent negatives in
various ways: 1's complement, 2's complement, signed positive integers,
whatever.  The GRIB message is rendered just that much more machine
independent by being non-negative throughout.

     The second benefit is more consequential:  it can result in a
substantial compression of the bulletin size without any loss of
information content.  If a field has an appreciable bias away from
zero, the residuals formed by the minimum removal operation will all be
much smaller numbers than otherwise.  Thus they will need fewer bits to
contain them when they are, eventually, packed as integers.

     The third step is simply to scan through the field of residuals
and find the maximum value.

     At this point another choice must be made, similar to the one made
previously.  This time, if a variable bit word length is to be used,
then it is necessary to calculate how many bits (per word or per data
gridpoint) are going to be needed to contain that largest data value,
when the latter has been rounded to an integer.  Recall that at the
previous decision point, the variables were power-of-ten (&quot;D&quot;) scaled
such that a rounding operation will preserve all the significant part
of the information.  Discovering how many bits are needed is a simple
scan through a table of powers of two, of course.  The power-of-two-
scaling is not employed and E is set equal to 0.  Then go on to the
fourth step.

     If, alternatively, it is desired to use a pre-selected bit word
length for the packed variables, the data must now be scaled, this time
by a power of two (the &quot;E&quot; scaling), sufficient to either reduce the
maximum value down to just fit into the available number of bits, or
enlarge the value to just fit.  This latter step takes care of the
problem of small numbers where the precision is all in the fractional
part of the number.  How much precision is retained, for the eventual
rounding, is a function of the preselected bit word length and the
&quot;typical&quot; range, or maximum value with the minimum removed, of the
particular variable.  The choice of bit word length, which is made
ahead of time, must be made with full knowledge of the characteristics
of the particular variable that is to be packed and a prior assumption
of how much precision needs to be retained for the largest likely
value.

     The fourth step is then to round all the values to integers, now
that they have all been scaled to appropriate units, and pack them in
the specified bit length words.

     The last step is then to set up the various identification fields
and put the GRIB bulletin in proper form.  We shall turn to this
&quot;proper form&quot; in the next section.

     We have ended up with two alternate ways to construct a GRIB
messages:  a fixed bit word length method and a variable bit word
length method. What are the relative advantages or disadvantages, or at
least the differences, of one with respect to the other?

     Message length: the fixed word length bulletins are always the
same length, for a given parameter; the variable word length bulletins
are, naturally, variable.  The variation is driven by the range of the
value of the parameter over the field (or the maximum value) which can
change from day to day.  Whether variations in message length is a
problem or not depends on the computer systems used to work with the
GRIB records.

     Precision:  The variable word length bulletins have a fixed and
unchanging precision, determined by the &quot;D&quot; scaling.  This assures that
the same information content is available day after day.  It is
straightforward to change the precision in a familiar manner, that is,
simply by orders of magnitude, just by altering the D value.  This
comes at a cost, of course; increasing the precision by a power of 10
adds about 3.3 bits (average) to each data point in the message.

     The fixed word length bulletins show a variable precision which is
case by case data driven and is determined by the &quot;E&quot; (power-of-two)
scaling that was used to fit the numbers into the available space.
This can happen even with the same data, on the same date, but at
adjacent grid areas.  If one area shows a low variability and the
neighboring one a high variability such that a different power-of-two
scaling is needed in the two areas, then, unfortunately, the values on
a common boundary will not be exactly equal after they are unpacked.
This can be disconcerting and a cause for confusion.  It will not
happen if D-scaling (only) is employed.  On the other hand, the
variable precision can be viewed as a strength:  a data field with a
low variability will be encoded at a higher precision, thus preserving
the character of the field; a high variability field will be
represented with less precision, but that is not a problem as the
small, and possibly lost, variations will not matter in the presence of
the large ones.  The precision of the encoded field can be increased by
adding bits to the fixed word length, but the degree of change (a power
of 2 for each bit) may not be as easy to deal with (or explain to
people) as the simple order of magnitude change afforded by the &quot;D&quot;
scaling method.

     No mater which packing method was employed, a proper GRIB decoding
program, that took account of the transmitted values of both &quot;D&quot; and
&quot;E&quot;, would return the correct unpacked numbers, regardless of which
packing method was employed.  It would be transparent to the user
except for the questions of precision outlined above.


GRIB CODE FORM.

     With the exception of the first four octets of the Indicator
Section, and the End Section, all octets contain binary values.  All
sections contain an even number of octets; the variable length sections
are padded with zero values as necessary.  These extra bits must be
accounted for in finding one's way through the sections; their content
should be ignored.
